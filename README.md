# MatchaDataset
a dataset simulating matcha tea farming with variables like sunlight, rainfall, and temperature â€” then trained an LSTM model in PyTorch to predict plant trait evolution (like leaf quality and harvest yield).  A cool way to explore eco-AI, agriculture, and how environmental conditions impact crops
